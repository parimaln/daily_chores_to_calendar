# daily_chores_to_calendar
This is a simple android application to add daily chores to google calendar of your choice quickly and simply, you can create chores shortcuts and select them from home screen to add to google calendars.
Currently I am using calendar intent as there is a bug in calendar provider for location which deletes the location from event after sync, 
once it gets resolved I will add that.
